### Lessons learnt during the project
* Fundaments of web development - core concepts like understanding HTTP requests and status codes or post-redirect-get modelling
* MVC architecture and how it compares to layered or micro service architectures
* Fragmenting and modularly designing the front of the application
* Creating and using configuration profiles for different development stages
* Adding different layers of tests from unit test to UI functionality testing
* Basic user authentication and authorization

## Service functionalities
* Users may register to the service and log in and out to the service
* User has their own profile where they may add a profile picture and list skills for other users to see - like a small resume
